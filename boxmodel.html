      express their feelings,or even tell a story. <br>

The best rappers tell the best stories, often about their own lives and how they worked hard through life 
and made their way to being one of the greatest.

            professional chaos. A 2014 “Drake vs. Lil Wayne” co-headlining tour unexpectedly evolved into a poignant torch-passing affair.
